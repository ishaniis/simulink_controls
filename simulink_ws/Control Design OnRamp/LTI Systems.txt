What are LTI? 
LTI -> Linear Time Invariant

(a) Linear System(Follows the principle of Superposition) + Time Invariant System

Characterisitics of LTI:
1. Will follow the Law of Superposition
1.1 Low of Homogeneity
1.2 
2. Any delay in input -> is reflected -> In the Output

3.1 Input
S(t))
x(t)

3.2 Output
y(t)
h(t) -> Impulse Response to show O/P of LTI

3.3.1 It'll be difficult to work with time-domain to get the system relationship of input with the output, 
3.3.2 so we'd work with Frequency Domain -> that is possible through Laplace(time domain -> Frequency Domain) 
3.3.3 Using the system relationship between Input and the Output, you could potentially calculate the Transfer Function of the system. 

4. Using Fourier or Laplace, where H(s) and H(omega) are your transfer functions
4.1 If you were to use Fourier over the impulse response -> You'll get H(omega) [World of Real Numbers]
4.2 If you were to use Laplace over the impulse response -> You'll get H(s) [World of Complex Numbers -> Complex Plane] 

5. After having transfer function, you can go back to time response using either
5.1.1 Inverse Fourier Transform 
5.1.2 Inverse Laplace Transform
