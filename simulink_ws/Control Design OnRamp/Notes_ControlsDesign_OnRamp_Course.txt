Control Design using simulink

1. A common input signal that many control engineers use to explore the plant is the unit step signal.

2. Lens Movement:
(Range of Current with unit step block: [0,1]
2.1 1 mA (Current) -> 20.73 micro metres
2.2 So Current is directly proportional to the displacement produced. If Current 10x, so the displacement will also be 10x (In this model of Camera considered for this course)

3.1 By default, the Step block changes the input from 0 to 1 (mA) at 1 second. As you saw in the previous task, the lens moves to 20.73 micrometers in response to a 1 mA current input.
3.2 For a linear system, if the current is increased by a factor of 10 (to 10 mA), the lens would also move 10 times further to 207.3 micrometers. 
3.2.1 Intended Behavior: 207.3 micrometres
3.2.2 Observed Behavior: 186.7 micrometres (for 10x increase in Current)
3.2.3 Conclusion: Plant is Non linear and exhibits a non-linear behavior. 

Section 2: 

S2.1 Observations:
Overshoot is happening(Final Position) and settling time performance(3 seconds to reach steady state) need to be tweaked.

S2.2 Objective: 
(Linear Time Invariant Systems)

S2.3 Linear vs Non Linear Systems
S2.3.1 Linear: Input has a linear relationship with Output
S2.3.2 Non Linear: Input has a nonLinear relationship with Output

S2.4 One way of working with Non Linear Systems -> To Linearize the systems -> So that performance can be predicted and controlled accordingly. 

S2.5 Let's dive into this stream and action plan:
S2.5.1.1 If you see a parabola over the Non Linear System(Call it an example of Lift Force (y) = k*u^2
S2.5.1.2 Where, y-> Lift Force, u-> Velocity, Tangent on the parabola of the equation gives you the Operating Point (Using LTI system -> Linear System)

S2.6 By linearizing, you found LTI system with similar behavior, which emulates the same behavior as that of the Non Linear System in reference. 

S2.7 In Simulink, you achieve it using through the Linearization toolbox -> Model Linearization -> which will effectively find that LTI system for your Non Linear System. 

Section 3:
S3.1 In Linearization toolbox, Select your Input & Output respectively (Specify it using Linearization toolbox)
Then you specify Operating Point. -> LTI system is obtained under the Workspace. 

S3.2 To linearize the plant in Simulink, you need to tell Simulink which portion of the model is the plant.
This is done by adding linear analysis points to specify the input and output signals as the plant's input and output.

S3.3 You have obtained an LTI system by linearizing the plant. The LTI approximation of the plant should behave like the actual plant near the operating point.
