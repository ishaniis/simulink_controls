1.1 In Continous systems, time is expressed continous over a specific interval -> Methodology utilized -> First Order Differential Equations
This kind of systems are expressed using the Differential Equations. 

2.1 Whereas, Discrete systems, where the system is observed at different states, over discretized intervals of time -> This schema of systems which are observed over discretized intervals of time are
called discrete systems. 

3.1 Unit Delay & it's uses: 
3.1.1. A discrete, dynamic system is a model of a system's current state, x[k], based on current or previous states. 
3.1.2. The Unit Delay block (Simulink > Discrete) takes an input signal and holds its value for the specified sample time. At the next time step, it outputs the held input value. 
3.1.3 The block has the symbol 1/z.
3.1.4. Representing a delay of one time step in the Z-transform domain.


4. Continous Systems
4.1.1 The Integrator block (Simulink > Continuous) has the symbol 1/s
4.1.2. Representing integration in the Laplace domain. 
4.1.3. Its output is the integral of the input signal.

5.Next Modelling to be done: 
5.1. Half-Car Suspension System model
5.2. Friction Model with hard stops

6.Simulation Time:
6.1 Characteristics of dynamic systems can vary widely; for example, they can be:
6.1.1 discrete
6.1.2 Continuous
6.1.3 Fast
6.1.4 Slow. 

6.2 To account for this, Simulink includes many types of numerical solvers.

7. Solver in Simulink
7.1 Simulink knows how to assess the properties of your system and automatically select a good solver for you.
7.2 However, the auto-solver cannot determine how long your simulation should run.

8. Automatic Step Size Selection

8.1. Simulation stop time can also be a factor if you are observing unexpectedly jagged responses.
8.2. The automatic solver typically calculates the maximum time step as: h(max) = [ t(stop) - t(start) ] / 50
